🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy

Pandas

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit-learn

📂 Data Used

Small set of sample sentences

Used only for learning and demonstration

No external dataset required

⚙️ Steps Involved
1️⃣ Text Input

Sentences are defined manually

Acts as raw text data

2️⃣ Tokenization

Each word is converted into a number

Vocabulary (word index) is created

3️⃣ Text to Sequence Conversion

Sentences are transformed into integer sequences

Each word is replaced by its token value

4️⃣ Padding (if applied)

Makes all sequences the same length

Required for neural network models

5️⃣ Embedding Layer

Converts words into dense vectors

Captures semantic meaning of words

6️⃣ Model Creation

Simple neural network using:

Embedding layer

Flatten layer

Dense layer

7️⃣ Compilation and Training

Model is compiled

Trained on sample text data to learn embeddings
